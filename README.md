###OpenRadio
=========


OpenRadio is a toolkit for creating an online and offline radio using open source software and inexpensive tools. The objective is to list and document what are the essential components for mounting a radio lo-fi technology.

This fork is maintained by Pacific Northwest (N. America) LPFM community groups. The project was originally organized by the group 'Hacks / Hackers Chile' in 2013.


###Wishlist

Tools - management and automation of radio programming

Tools - audience interaction (text message , voice and online, chat )

Tools - mobile reporting and transmission from cell

Streaming - tools at low cost

Systems of distribution and use of free platforms

###Why do it

In countries such as Chile and other Latin American countries , the radio, especially outside the big cities, is the primary means of communication. However, in most cases, the community and local radio does not have the resources nor the technology to enhance their work and better linked with their listeners, who in most cases have the radio as a vehicle of information and essential communication. That's why at Hacks / Hackers Chile have decided to open the online help hackatones focused radio show, teaching and reusing low cost technologies already in use in Africa - a continent where radio is the protagonist.
